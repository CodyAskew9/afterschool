      <p> With our younger class, our primary focus is classroom technology and basic computer skills.
        We are working on typing practice at the start of every class with <a href="https://www.typing.com/">Typing.com.</a>
        <br />
      After we are warmed up and ready to type, we do a guided lesson. This week we are working on learning sequencing and learning how to be very clear with instructions.
      This will transfer to the next lesson, where we work on coding animation with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch.</a>
      <br />
      At this time we do not have accounts set up yet for all of our students due to an internet outage right at the end of class.
