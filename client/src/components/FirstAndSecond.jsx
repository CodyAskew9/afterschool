      <p> With our younger class our primary focus is classroom technology, and basic computer skills.
        we are working on typing practice at the start of every class with <a href="https://www.typing.com/">Typing.com.</a>
        <br />
      After we are warmed up and ready to type we do a guided lesson. This week we are working on learning sequencing learning how we have to be very clear with instructions.
      This transfers to our next part where we work on coding animation with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch.</a>
      <br />
      At this time we do not have accounts set up for all of our student due to a internet outage right at the end of class.
