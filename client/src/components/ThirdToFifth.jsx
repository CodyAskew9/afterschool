      <p>With our third trough fifth graders we start our day with a typing warm-up with <a href='https://www.typing.com/'>Typing.com.</a>
      <br /> From there we are off to our guided lesson on <a href='https://codesandbox.io/'>Code Sand Box</a>.<br /> We are starting off with learning HTML and the language of the internet, as I believe it is an invaluable skill for any coder.
      I plan to spend a few weeks going over this and end with a project of making a website as a group. <br/> After the guided project they are free to work on coding animations or games with the help of <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/'>Scratch.</a>
      <br />
      Due to an unforeseen internet issue we were unable to finish account setup this last week but will have it working this upcoming week.

      Pictures to come!
