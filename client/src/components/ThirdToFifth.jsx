      <h1>Third To Fifth Grade</h1>
      <p>With our third trough fifth graders we start our day with a typing warm-up with <a href='https://www.typing.com/'>Typing.com.</a>
      <br /> From there we are off to our guided lesson on <a href='https://codesandbox.io/'>Code Sand Box</a>.<br /> We are starting off with learning HTML and the language of the internet, as I believe it is an invaluable skill for any coder.
      I plan to spend a few weeks going over this and end with a project of making a website as a group. <br/> After the guided project they are free to work on coding animations or games with the help of <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/'>Scratch.</a>
      <br />
      Due to an unforeseen internet issue we were unable to finish account setup this last week but will have it working this upcoming week.

      Pictures to come!

          First Month Finished
        </h2>
        <p>
          As we finish our first month we have greatly improved our typing skills.
          We have learned the basic structure of HTML and websites, we are starting to learn how to style them wit CSS and make them more than just words on a page!
          We Learned about sequencing a core skills for computer science as well as learning about loops and conditional statements these are skills that can transfer into any coding language.
        </p>

          What's Next
        </h2>
         <p>
           As we move into the next month we will continue our practice of building websites as well as work on our problem solving skills by working in pairs where one person is the driver and will make code for the program while the other tells them what the program should do.
